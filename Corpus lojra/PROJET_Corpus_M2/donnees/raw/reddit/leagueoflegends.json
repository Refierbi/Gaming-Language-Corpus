        "title": "Does Kled seem like a champion that should have health scalings or otherwise build tankier?",
        "text": "Kled is probably one of the most unique champions in the game, and as a relatively mobile skirmisher he's a bit of an outlier in that rather than having some inbuilt sustain or building life steal, he has the dual health bar and courage mechanic for survivability. His kit is fully oriented towards encouraging him to keep fighting instead of retreating at all costs. Passive is restored by fighting, he goes from extremely slow to extremely fast by targeting champs while dismounted, Q needs him to stay in range, W value is backloaded, half of E is tied to hitting a champ, and his ult is literally for charging into battle. \n\nDespite his kit giving the impression that he'd like to be in extended fights, he's been played with primarily glass cannon assassin style builds for a while now. He's had periods where he was more of a stridebreaker or ravenous hydra champ recently, but it's been a while since he was going for high hp bruiser or even tank builds. \n\nThis isn't actually surprising if you take a closer look at his kit and playstyle, high AD ratios, an attack speed steroid to utilize AD, and defensive stats being near useless when he's dismounted essentially force him towards more offensive builds, and he's consistently pretty balanced with them all things considered. \n\nStill, Kled seems more like a champ who was designed to build items like Titanic hydra, black cleaver and steraks rather than eclipse, profane hydra and more lethality/arpen. Of course there's no reason to fix what isn't broken, but I'm just wondering if anyone else got the impression Kled should be less of a glass cannon style champ. Have I missed something and Kled was always intended to be played as he is now? \n\nI think it might be possible to open up both build paths by giving Kled HP scalings on some of his mounted abilities or still granting a portion of bonus HP to his dismounted form, but I can already imagine the potential balance issues so it's understandable if Riot would rather not touch him.

        "text": "⭐Hello, my name is miLt, i am an **OTP Yi that peaked 920 LP in Challenger** last year.  \nThe purpose of this post is ➡**NOT to ask for buffs⬅**, quite the opposite: revert one of the most forced changes they made for yi.\n\nOn patch 12.5, Riot did a midscope on Yi with the objective to **end the duskblade build**. In resume, they **reduced his Q AD scaling from 100% to 50% and made it SCALE DOWN with Ability Haste**, and to compensate, they made his **Q apply on-hit effects** (including his E true damage), so the on-hit build wouldn't be affected, only the duskblade crit one.\n\nThose changes worked, and pretty much killed dusk-crit build for Yi. But as you may know, Duskblade is not in the game anymore for more than a year, and before Duskblade was reworked to give invisibility in season 11, **Crit/AD/CDR Yi was NEVER meta**. For 10+ years, on-hit was pretty much always the best build overall, so its easy to conclude **Duskblade was always the problem**, and since it is out of the game, **this midscope made is now pointless.**\n\nBut why is that needed to be reverted? For a couple reasons:\n\n* **➡Build Variety:** Since 12.5, Yi's build is **ONLY on-hit items**: BORK, Rageblade, Kraken, Wits, thats it. If the AH scale down was removed and his AD scalings increased, he would be able to build crit better again and even some other stuff as well.\n* **➡Inconsistent interactions:** Since yi's Q apply on-hit effects 4 times, a **LOT of stuff had to be hardcoded so his Q does not apply**, since it would be insanely broken: Conqueror, Kraken Slayer, Terminus, PTA, etc. Future stuff can cause even more trouble making it even more inconsistent.\n* **➡Fairness overall:** As mentioned before, the fact that his Q apply his E true damage makes Yi locked on that on-hit pattern, changing even the smallest amount of true damage from his E can break the champion completely, he is insanely restricted to any changes because of that, in either build or kit numbers.\n\nNumbers can always be adjusted for it to be more balanced, since the game changed a lot since season 12, but this midscope needs to be reverted, Yi is insanely tied to it since it was made, and it would be more fair for both him and his opponents.",

If the current HUD is there to stay I made some improvements for better readability. When I watch League I want to know why this player is ahead of enemy, so having CS numbers and K/D/A in own row is a must and I can immediately see what's the reason for a player to be ahead. Having shut down gold, K/D/A and CS stuffed under each one in low font is terrible so I focused on implementing this aspect in my design. Let me know If I did a good job or not. It's just my idea, I tried to include everything that was missing and tweak some things to make it similar to old HUD.\n\n[Here's a link to images](https://imgur.com/a/34489b6)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1oszbdrm2oe1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc0317e9d64984306d21fca6f8320a64eb4f95c4",

There really is nothing quite like this game at its best.  The micro and macro strategic complexity and the joy of playing with teammates and against opponents who are actively trying their best, and experiencing that success, despite moments of hardship, is just so rewarding. Playing well against skilled opponents and getting sick outplays, learning to find footing in difficult scenarios, learning from mistakes; it's just such a complete experience and has given me so much joy for the past 12 years of my life. Of course there are times where I'm tilted and frustrated, be it with myself, my teammates, or my opponents.  But the core experience of the game is just as good as it has ever been, in my opinion.",

Each Augment, Prismatic and Champion has their own dedicated details section on their respective pages which provides any additional information, this includes things such as:\n\n* Interactions between other augments/mechanics\n* Unexpected synergies or combinations\n* Graphics (such as the ones featured above) which display all items which interact with the more complicated augments such as Apex Inventor and Vulnerability\n* Links to similar Augments which provide synergies.\n* And a lot more!\n\nDue to the nature of the game-mode, I am not going to be able to personally test and verify every possible interaction, so I am asking all of you(!) to help contribute as much information relating to any interactions or synergies as you can through the website's submission form, I will be updating the website daily throughout the duration of the game mode to add any additional information or remove anything that no longer works. I will prioritize keeping the website as reliable as possible.\n\nAny contributions are greatly appreciated, including any reports if the website isn't working quite how it should be, I did learn to create websites specifically for this project, so please forgive any errors lmao.\n\nI hope this resource can make this game more accessible and enjoyable for all of you, thank you for reading :)",

        "text": "If you're playing a mage, don't waste your time trying to poke them out. You don’t want to overextend or lose careless minions. You really just want to make sure you have lane prio, farm well and slightly poke them when you can. It's unlikely you'll succeed before your first recall. Plus, if the Yone or Akali player is as skilled as you or better, they'll know exactly how to counter it. From my experience, the best approach is to accept the matchup and focus on scaling—opt for a late-game rune page and start with either a Dark Seal, tear or a Mana Crystal along with a Refillable Potion. After your first recall with lost chapter(which should be sooner assuming you got mana crystal), then focus on poking them since the effects of d-shield and second wind are a lot less potent. ",

The series is expected to be released on Netflix, HBO, and other platforms.\n\nMs. Lam shared that after surveying several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Thailand, Riot Studios decided on Vietnam as the most suitable location for its creative and production needs. Cát Bà was deemed an ideal filming site.\n\nNicholas Simon, Director of Indochina Productions, emphasized that filming in Hải Phòng is a great opportunity to promote Vietnam. With a vast audience, this project is expected to generate a positive impact on tourism and the country's image.\n\n",

        "text": "I’ve been playing League of Legends for a while now, and one thing that has always felt a little off to me is the lack of a transparency setting for the minimap!!! Given how crucial the minimap is for macro play, I think adding an adjustable transparency option would be a great QoL improvement for a lot of players!!!\n\nWhy It Matters\n\t1.\tBetter Peripheral Awareness – Sometimes, the minimap can feel like an intrusive block in the corner of the screen, especially when intense fights happen near the bottom-right or top-left sides of the map!!! A semi-transparent minimap would allow players to track fights more clearly while still keeping map awareness!!!\n\t2.\tLess Visual Clutter – With all the UI elements in League, the screen can get pretty busy!!! Being able to fine-tune the minimap’s opacity would let players balance visibility without losing information, similar to how we can already adjust the HUD scale!!!\n\t3.\tAccessibility & Personal Preference – Every player experiences visual processing differently!!! Some might find a fully opaque minimap too distracting, while others might want it more transparent to focus on the game!!! Giving players the option ensures that everyone can tailor the UI to their comfort!!!\n\nWhy It Should Be an Option\n\nNot everyone would want a transparent minimap, and that’s totally fine!!! But the key here is customization!!! Riot already provides multiple HUD customization settings (like ability bar opacity and floating text options), so adding a slider for minimap transparency would fit right in!!! It wouldn’t affect balance or gameplay—just give players more control over their experience!!!\n\nWhat do you all think??? Would a transparency setting for the minimap improve your gameplay experience???",

        "text": "Hey summoners! I'm excited to share a tool I've been working on that help players optimize their damage output in league. LeagueSim is an open-source simulator that lets you experiment with different item builds and ability combinations to find the most effective setups. As opposed to other simulators, League Sim provides exact damage numbers and a detailed breakdown on how much damage occurred when and why. This makes it very easy to replicate in-game and make sure that the results of the sim are reliable.\n\nThe tool has 3 modes:\n\n1. 🔍 Item Optimizer: Tests every item combination and finds the combination with the highest damage output.\n2. 🎯 Combo Optimizer: Tests every ability combination and finds the shortest ability sequence to kill the target.\n3. 📊 Single Simulation: Test a specific build and ability sequence.\n\nCurrently, the tool only supports Kha'Zix (with plans to expand to other champions). It is perfect for theorycrafting and understanding the math behind your builds.\n\nTech Stack:\n\n* Frontend: Vue.js\n* Simulation logic: Rust compiled to WebAssembly for performance\n\n**Try it out:**\n\nWebsite: [https://chaodhib.github.io/league-sim/](https://chaodhib.github.io/league-sim/)\n\nProject link (for contributions, bugs reports & feature suggestions): [https://github.com/chaodhib/league-sim](https://github.com/chaodhib/league-sim)\n\nNotables limitations and known bugs (the full list is on github):\n\n* Only Kha'zix is supported for now. The project is particularly open for contributions in this regard.\n* As the target, only a dummy target is supported for now (meaning a bag of HP and Armor + MR)\n* There is no way to change runes for now\n* There is no way to change the skill order for now\n* No summoner spells\n* Not all items are supported yet (but all major items for Kha'Zix are)\n* When the simulation runs, the page will freeze until the simulation has ended. This will be fixed in a later version.\n\nThe project is open source and we welcome contributions - whether it's adding support for new champions, reporting bugs, or suggesting features!",

I plan to use the game’s assets, such as champion portraits, icons, and skill icons. The project is completely free and mainly for fun, but I’m considering integrating Google AdSense in the future to help cover hosting and domain costs.\n\nI’ve looked into their **Legal Jibber Jabber** (https://www.riotgames.com/en/legal) and found that they allow passive ad revenue for some content. Specifically, they mention:\n\n*\"We allow passive ad revenue generation for some content.\"\n\"We permit individual players to promote their Projects on websites, streams, or videos and passively generate revenue through appropriate advertisements, including pre-roll ads, ad breaks, and sponsor ad overlays.\"*\n\nBased on this, it seems like my project would be allowed. However, I also saw the rule:\n\n**3. No unauthorized games or apps.**\n\nMy project isn’t a mobile app or a full-fledged game, it's just a website with interactive mini-games. I want to make sure I’m in the clear before proceeding.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this, or know if there’s a way to directly contact them for clarification? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!\n\n",

We can actually see a team clinch advancement to the knockouts with a specific outcome tonight. \n\nTL would advance to the knockouts if and only if: \n\n* TL beat TES\n* CFO beat KC\n\nWith those results, TL would go 2-0 and TES and KC would be at 0-2 still having to play one another. As one of them would automatically go 1-3 at best, TL would finish ahead of them which would lock them into knockouts. \n\nIs it super likely? Nah. Is it an interesting storyline heading into tonight when some people thought TL was the weakest team heading into the tournament? Sure. \n\nAll other scenarios result in no teams locking in knockouts today.\n\nEdit: Corrected a CFO to KC.",

And when i check my opponent profile that game doesnt exist. I think the challengers on Challenge (['Challenge Points Leaderboard' Challenge Overview, Thresholds and Leaderboards](https://challenges.darkintaqt.com/challenge/0)) are probably the same.

I would buy such a skin for my Main in a heartbeat. Am I cooking or am I cooked?",

        "title": "Has League of Legends Become Less Enjoyable to Play?",
        "text": "I don’t know why, but over the last 6–9 months, it feels like almost every game has some sort griefing, inting, or giving up before the 10-minute mark. More often than not, it’s a smurf creating an imbalanced match, by either completely dominating, farming AFK, or whining and running it down. Especially in ranks from Emerald up to Diamond 1, this happens in nearly every game.\n\nIt took me 200 games to climb from Emerald 4 to Emerald 1 and about 100 more to reach Diamond 1. The problem is that many players in the first division are so on edge that they don’t realize the main reason they aren’t ranking up is because they throw every second game.\n\nFor me, League isn’t even enjoyable until I reach Master: fewer smurfs, fewer players intentionally throwing, and less flaming. The issue is that I can’t climb to Master fast enough each season to actually enjoy the game. The only real solution I’ve found is duoing with someone who won’t FF at 15, doesn’t flame, and actually tryhards with me, ideally being at least high Diamond or Master. Even then, we still get griefers, inters, or people throwing every other game. (Btw the guy Im playing with tried to grief me, and we won 4 vs 5, after that I saw he was high dia stuck in emerald and added him as friend and told him to stay cool, play for fun, never give up. 67% wr on 24 games so far and he seems to be cured. nice.)\n\nI think we need some kind of performance-based metric so that players don’t lose a flat 20 LP just because a high-Diamond smurf in Emerald decides you deserve to lose for not following a single ping - even in a game you were actually winning (pain). If LP gains and losses were more dynamic, say losing only 10 LP when you play well and gaining 30 LP when you hard-carry, I wouldn’t mind as much. But as it stands, even with a 60% win rate over 10 games, just one tilted smurf throwing a game you should’ve won can drag you down to a 50% win rate.\n\nI get that smurfing isn’t outright forbidden and is nearly impossible to prevent, but I’d really like a system where, if I play like Faker and my ADC goes 2/17/5, I don’t lose 20 LP and feel like I wasted 35 minutes just to see the defeat screen. It could also just be like a 3 LP up or down difference, still better then nothing.",

        "text": "I think fearless is good in theory and getting players to branch out of the same boring/meta champs is good. Ksante vs gnar/renekton top gets boring to watch.\n\nHowever, by game 5, the most important game, the drafts become overcooked. Without fearless these drafts wouldn't happen which means these aren't optimal drafts, and game 5 they are more extreme because of how fearless bans work. It just becomes some weird handicap that restricts the level of league being played in order to give fans more variety. \n\nPeople will argue that pros should just practice more champs. I keep seeing people saying we should reward champ oceans. But I don't think people understand what practice looks like for pros. Pros can play a ton of champions, they are pros. Pro players typically practice their core champs and then they will rotate through practicing specific champs when the meta shifts and certain champs become strong. Usually each pro will have 2-3 champs they are focusing on learning/improving, because of the current meta and drafts they want. Do you want pros sacrificing champ mastery for champ breadth? You have limited time to practice. In the month leading up to worlds, if certain champs are considered D tier for pro play, why would you practice them? Because there's a small chance the drafts go a certain way and then game 5 they target ban 3 adcs on top of the fearless bans??? There's a difference between being decent at a champ and grinding it in the month leading up to worlds during scrims, soloq, and practice tool. You can't just practice a fuckton of champs without sacrificing depth of specific champion practice \n\nDisregarding the practice aspect. Even if you practice 20 champs. The concept of \"meta\" implies that there are strong and weak champs. Resorting to weak champs out of necessity because of draft fuckery and target bans isn't entertaining. Losing or winning based on draft/ban outcomes is fine because we get to see some unique picks? These picks are weak, that's why they're not meta and the pros don't pick it unless they have to",
