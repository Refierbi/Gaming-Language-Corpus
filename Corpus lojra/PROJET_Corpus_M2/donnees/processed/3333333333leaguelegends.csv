did riot decide to get rid of your shop
"your shop is a periodic skin sale thats based on each players match history it used to occur 5 times a year lasting for about a month each time with a month or a month and half break between each occurance the first yearly one happening around valentines day at least in the last 3 years

 in 2022 previous years your shop ended january 17th and a new one began on february 10th
 in 2023 previous years your shop ended january 3rd and a new one began on february 13th
 in 2024 previous years your shop ended january 11th and a new one began on february 14th

this year previous years your shop ended january 1st we are on february 17th and there hasnt been one since making me wonder if riot decided to scrap this concept alongside other monetisation changes they made"

bounty system is still broken and needs to be addressed
"one of yesterdays matches was a great showcase of that

httpspreviewredditw623kfa1wnje1jpgwidth2559formatpjpgautowebpsf27117c84c72b2423974da618ca2538dcc3ee3ef

 ksante is the only player with a bounty here hes not ahead of his opponent 174g his entire team is very behind down by 4k gold 2 turrets and 6 void grubs  at 17 minutes

 meanwhile vi is up 16k gold over her opponent and hasnt died yet no bounty

 azir is up 11k gold with no deaths no bounty

 even braum is up 840 gold hasnt died yet and doesnt have a bounty

how many times does riot need to work on bounties before they stop doing the complete opposite of what theyre meant to do here theyre literally a snowball mechanic instead of a comeback mechanic this really needs to be addressed

theres a change coming soon that will remove bounties from the losing team when objective bounties are up but it wont fix anything in cases like this match here"

true damage amplification is kind of wild right now no
"httpswwwleagueoflegendscomenusnewsgameupdatespatch2025s13noteshttpswwwleagueoflegendscomenusnewsgameupdatespatch2025s13notes

  
they put out modifiers for true damage now 

i was asking myself how a cho gath managed to eat me for 1462 true damage while his r said max was 1050 darius r did 1100 to me at lvl 12 which i was completely shocked as i mained him for a year and never did that 

asked around and somehow completely missed this change 

how are yall finding it so far seems pretty extreme

edit just found out about axiom arcanist  and holy fuck im sick of it i didnt even realize they added in a 14 damage rune that amplifies true damage "

as for braum i dont remember if his shield blocks it or not

mid and top both proxying for 305 more xp
"tldr  if mid and top are both proxying at nexus they gain 305 more xp than if they were to be in their respective lane

  
the way xp works in league of legends follow this rule 

if there is one person picking up the xp the minion gives 95 of his xp

if there is 2 or more the minion gives 124 of his xp so if 2 people then 62 each and so on

  
so if mid and top were to proxy in the ennemy base they would both gain each 124 xp for the midtop wave instead of only 95 of the xp they would have otherwise gained

this is an increased of 305 of xp gain for the both of them

  
you need to play strong champion in 2v2 and its very hard to get you out of your proxy position because the only ones that can come kill you without losing anything is jglsupp which is obviously not strong enough to win the 2v2 even if you die you dont lose anything cause of the insane tempo you create by proxying

appreciating what was the lore
"

i never cared about league lore not until legends of runeterra came around it was awesome that i get to explore the universe with those flavor texts when the side characters get their own small bios where you get teased for new characters because you care about the lore from loryone 

but ever since arcane came around or more specifically became the canon all of the emotional investment i had for the lore just came crashing down lor as cool as it was became obsolete all the artists work of creating the art for those characters and the writers having knowing exactly where to put them all that love and hardwork felt like it was gone 

i would like to clarify first that i thought arcane was great but it was very clearly meant to be an extended alternative universewith the design changes and how the story goes and what not and theres nothing wrong with that but to say the jinx we had was just a harley quinn character show how little riot respect their own ip and whats that to stop them to butcher the other characters you love aswell

im sorry if this post came off as a rambly but does anyone feel like this aswell"

lots of champions have undodgeable abilities math
"hey yall notorious mel q complainer here a common argument i saw in the comments of my previous posthttpswwwredditcomrleagueoflegendscomments1il9mckmel_q_is_not_dodgeable_math was about how many abilities in league are actually undodgeable i think a lot of people will be surprised by how tight the accuracy requirements are to make abilities undodgeable lets work with the same assumptions as my previous post champ radius 65 base movement speed 335 and reaction time 200ms combined graphic for all champs mentionedhttpsimgurcomalolundodgeableskillshotsy1c6pru that being said lets start with mel q again clearly riot has seen and heard players frustration with mel q and they are nerfing it from the 154 preview

 cast range reduced 1000  950
 projectile speed reduced 5000  4500

this makes mel q take 046 seconds 025s cast  021s travel to reach its target this means it is still undodgeable by a large margin

but what about our skillshot spamming champions the ones that are notorious for being hard or annoying to dodge

lets start with phreaks example in his 2504 preview videohttpsyoutubejagxpiy_atosiqnwcq1skoykliyivt1510 unfortunately it appears phreak has fallen into a case of numbers vs reality where the lol wiki would confirm his statement but in testing it is not the case the wiki states that the spell activates after a 04s delay this does not include the cast time which is vital in calculating dodgeability including cast time for a 065s cast this ability is definitely dodgeable with 50ms to spare however in video review i determined the actual casttodamage time is 085 seconds 005s for server tick and other error which is dodgeable with 025s to spare only if phreak is referring to dodging after the indicator appears on the ground which occurs after a 025s cast time is the ability undodgeable

how about xerath hes pretty unfair in good hands isnt he no all of xeraths abilities are entirely dodgeable in fact hes so fair that he even shows exactly where his abilities will hit to the enemy when he starts his cast giving players a better chance to dodge accurately compared to projectilebased skillshots xerath q is entirely dodgeable with 20ms to spare xerath w is even more dodgeable with 70ms to spare and as you might expect xerath r is dodgeable with 30ms to spare if youre playing with 30ms ping you might have trouble with q and r

the highest voted comment on my previous post was about viktor e this one is a little more complicated because it is a disconnected projectile skillshot starting from anywhere in viktors 550 range targeting beam start circle this skillshot is mostly undodgeable for its length assuming viktor starts his e at max range in his targeting circle the breakpoint for this ability is around 1000 units from viktor where the ability goes from definitely undodgeable to potentially dodgeable this ability becomes entirely undodgeable if you assume the player dodging moves at a 60 degree very averagehuman angle away from viktors skillshot as compared to a 90 degree dodge this makes viktors undodgeable range longer than mels 950 with the added challenge of a very tight aim to ensure undodgeability just take a look at the graphic at the end of the post its pretty egregious

while were on the topic of linear projectiles heres a few unique ones ahris q becomes undodgeable at 535 range and her e at 350 range this increases to 620 and 410 units respectively for a 60 degree dodge

auroras q becomes undodgeable at 580 range and her e is entirely undodgeable this increases to 670 units for a 60 degree dodge auroras e  q combo is entirely undodgeable by numerical integration may be wrong within 650 units

hwei qq is undodgeable within 510 units and qe is technically undodgeable if your opponent can click within 10 units of your center hwei eq is undodgeable within 200 units ew is always dodgeable and ee is always undodgeable moving perpendicular but always dodgeable moving towardaway from hwei the ee breakpoint is around 30 degrees off straight towardaway from hwei even if you center the largest part of the ee on a champion they can dodge it

syndras q is technically undodgeable if your opponent can click within 3 units of your center syndra w is dodgeable at all ranges and any combo of qe or we are always dodgeable syndra e stun becomes undodgeable within 700 units of syndra but only on existing spheres the cast time for q and w make syndra combos always dodgeable

lux q is undodgeable within 300 range and her e is undodgeable within 610 units her q increases to 360 range for a 60 degree dodge her q undodgeable threshold increases further to 430600 rank 15 linear if the enemy is slowed by her e

i believe this clearly shows mel q and viktor e are outliers compared to pretty much any other skillshot based on comments from both phreak and emizery rioter who posted mel changes in rmelmains it seems riot knows mel is a frustrating champ to play against as i mentioned in the previous post mel q will hit you for 100 damage if you only react to her damage but you only take 33 if you start moving as soon as you see her animation i think the best way to add counterplay to mel q would be to have it show its target indicator at the start of the cast time like xeraths abilities this would give players more power to avoid the majority of mel q and take minimal damage still undodgeable rather than guessing where the center of the q is and potentially being punished heavily from 1000 range id be interested in seeing some changes to viktor e as well such as adding a scaling cast time based on distance from viktor to his beam start location without stopping his movement like syndra q

if you can think of other abilities youd like to see calculated here or even some combos please let me know combined graphic for all champs mentionedhttpsimgurcomalolundodgeableskillshotsy1c6pru"

winlose repeatedly what do i do
"hey quick back story

ive played league for over 10 years played ranked on and off for about the same

ive peaked and hit diamond 4 but tilted back down to em3 when season ended about 3 years back 

i stopped playing ranked for about 2 years and recently got back into it because a friend of mine said i was washed  

so currently i played about 60ish games
i started off slow getting the hang of the changes and getting my mechanics back but once i did i won almost every game with utter ease i destroyed lane destroyed the other team and breezed all the way to emerald 4 i was getting great teams great teammates and playing against some good players i genuinely started to enjoy this game again 

the issue now same as when i quit ranked 
i duod with my friend he has over 200 games and was on a loss streak in emerald 4 and we ended up losing 

ever since that game i have consistently been winlosswinloss etc for the last roughly 15 games 

i considerably got all my mechanics back  seem to be doing everything i understand about the game really well but i cant seem to crack this streak 

it doesnt matter how well i do i am guaranteed a loss on its turn im very okay with carrying inters i understand not everyone on my team will do well but i am guaranteed my full team sprinting it down feeding arguing afking etc 

whereas when im on the turn to win there have been games where i just auto pilot feed play so horribly but still end up with a win my most recent in frustration partially to test this theory to my friend i played bad in purpose not inting but very lacklustre and we ended up stomping the game

ive seen multiple high elo master gm and challenger players talk about this algorithm league has set up for us to play more games but ive also seen the other half say that i just need to just play correctly but what even is playing correctly with a team like that

it was the reason i had quit playing this game and after falling in love with it again im ready to just go back to the other games 

im posting this to see if there is any way to break this algorithm or anyone has advice on this scenario because i genuinely enjoy competitive league but im not a fan of how the system works and refuse to waste my time when i play games to enjoy myself 

to the ones who will reply dont tilt you need a break i hope you can trust me when i say i really dont tilt rage or feel much emotion during these games my intention is to win and that is it ive played this game far too long to not have learned not to tilt ive played high level competitive sport in my life and have learned to control my emotion well 

if anyone cares to see my opgg i can share it if needed

i love watching league but im scared to play
"i have been watching pro and amateur league for about a year i love the game and the strategy that goes into it and i think its just a super fun and exciting game 

at this point i think ive reached the level of understanding of the game that i can have without actually playing it for myself for example champion drafting means very little to me i really want to pick it up but im super put off by the toxicity of the game does anyone have any tips for me for getting started or alternitively a different way for me to learn the more nuanced parts of the game so i can understand them

please feel free to explain things to me like im 5 because i dont even know very much about the different matchmakingqueuegame options im just really trying to maintain some level of optimism that there is still a way i can enjoy playing this game that i genuinely enjoy "

how do you pick your mains
hii so i have been playing league of legends for round about 7months and want to fully commit and lock in on the ranked climb but i for the life of me cannot stick to main or role i always bounce around from top lane to jungle to mid to support i love playing this game its super fun and a challenge but god do i hate having no one to otp atleast i love playing people like irelia or garen or gnar but just sometimes they dont hit right  
wabbyrabby
httpswwwredditcomrleagueoflegendscomments1irfijdhow_do_you_pick_your_mains
every person needs to play top for at least a couple of games
"disclaimer i do not believe that top is the hardest role in the sense that it is hardest to carryimpact or whatever but i do believe that it is without a doubt the most punishing during lane 

i genuinely believe that if people played top more they would get a better perspective of how the game goes and why certain things happen especially if you are in jungle it is the lane where i think it punishes micro the most and forces the player to learn and understand wavestate so many times i have had a jungle invade when my wave is frozen outside of enemy tower die and then ping or i have had junglers gank when a large wave was under tower only to be surprised i chose not to full int my lane to help them i absolutely understand why junglers will go for these plays ie top loooks like its pushing they must have prio or enemy pushed up easy gank

i am not an insane player by any means i have played for a couple of years now mostly top and support but when i focused on learning top and then applied the knowledge i got from it to support i am not kidding when i say i climbed more than 300 lp to get all the way to emerald 2 something as simple as using roam timers to help midtop get a better back timer by helping them shove or using that time to help them freeze a lane has won me more games than i can count and i think that jg players and support players hugely benefit from that knowledge as well i can go on and on but thats the gist no hate to jg players btw i have been so hard carried by jglers on days i played like sht"

so ive been watching pro matches and i noticed that they sometimes switch to the pros pov where you see the game just as if you were playing it yourself do they publish full vods of these recordings or do they get deleted afterward i really enjoy it more when i get their pov just like when streamers play

lta north has had 3 out of 4 weeks good teams vs bad teams bo3 xd
"this format is absolutely horrible 

3 out of 4 weeks has been good teams shitting on bad teams  with only week 2 having exciting games

week 1 we had fly c9 tl vs the worser teams week 3 was the battle of the worst with fly and tl vs shitters although they played eachother in a bo1 that didnt matter i guess 
week 4 is starting off with top na teams vs brazil teams which is looking exactly how weeks 1 and 3 looked 

3 out of 4 weeks of games that no one cares for  

when this shit fails and viewership plummets i hope they consider how horrible this format is before blindly blaming bo3 

lcs was seeing a bit of growth last year even with bo3 markz was doing a great job and people were excited to watch again then they went and pulled this move"

psa boots of swiftness are crazy good abuse them while it lasts
"need to make it to a team fight want to dodge skill shots want to engage want to disengage want to catch a wave before its eaten by a tower just buy boots of swiftness they provide a big advantage in all aspects of the game for nearly any champion sorry cass in fact league of graphs has boots of swiftness at a 533 win rate additionally swiftness boots near a 54 wr in masters games httpswwwleagueofgraphscomchampionsitemshttpswwwleagueofgraphscomchampionsitems

that being said all other boots sit below 522 win rate at any given rank though they tend toward 50 win rate depending on rank boots of swiftness were arguably overturned pre patch 1415 mass tier 2 boot nerfs and remain so mercury treads for example currently cost 200 more gold and has 5 less magic resistance contrasted with its pre 1415 stats similarly live sorcerer shoes only give 12 magic pen instead of 18 magic pen pre 1415 other tier 2 boots have been hit with largely the same degree of nerfs except for boots of swiftness which give the same pre 145 stats but only received an additional 100 gold cost slap on the wrist patch notesstat changes of the entire tier 2 boot roster is left as an exercise to the reader

heres what phreak had to say about boots in his recent 2504 patch preview tldw good players have identified that swiftys are quite good lowering their power level is tough he suggests a potential nerf being a cost increase of 50 gold also mentioning that symbiotic sols are not the greatest after explaining minor changes to plated steel caps mercury treads httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjagxpiy_atot1122shttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjagxpiy_atot1122s

50 gold cost could nudge swiftys win rate down but it would hardly address the current massive power discrepancy between them and other tier 2 boots post purchase its safe to say boots of swiftness will remain top tier in the foreseeable future

tldr boots of swiftness are very good right now and more often than not the game gets harder by choosing to purchase other tier 2 boots"

fix alttab while in game
"guys i need some help with an alttab issue while gaming recently whenever i try to switch between windows from inside a game alttab doesnt let me choose which window i want to go to instead of showing the window selection it just switches directly to the last one i used

for example lets say i have discord the lol client and lol ingame open if the last window i accessed before the game was discord pressing alttab inside the game takes me straight to discord instead of displaying the window selection however if im in any other program outside the game alttab works normally showing all open windows

has anyone experienced this issue or knows how to fix it"

illaoi tentacles should be able to spawn in select open areas but the range changes should be reverted
what if illaois season 14 changes were reverted in short she loses the extra tentacle range but gets her damage back but she also gets to spawn tentacles in certain open areas so as to avoid the dead zone problem not sure how this could be implemented for midlane though i think its tragic that a champion who only exists to do damage in a small radius cant pull off plays like thishttpswwwyoutubecomshortsulqgq4_xc0 anymore

hextech in the lore
" buenas reckon im becoming a huge lore nerd with this in this occasion well discuss one of my favorite elements on the lore nothing more interesting than this gonna dive right into it  
  
 hextech i think is a very original concept enables the narrative to shape in really creative ways and i want to  give some examples on how this manifests in the lore xerath we know is basically pure arcane embodied so you could assume this kind of power is limited to ancestral entities and whatnot but actually its also present on the most advanced technology made by mortals as well this dichotomy is something i always found innovating and exciting makes the world of runeterra feel more alive and connected cohesive emancipates magic from the supernatural by turning it into something quite natural and common almost indistinguishable from science coherence is a very important factor when introducing fantasy elements to your stories you cant just come up with the first thing on your mind and justify it all with its just fantasy hextech is coherent to the point of being even convincing makes you feel like something like this could exist in our universe  
  
 ceasing with the compliments here comes a little of a critic hextech is well written but i think lacks personality in terms of how it looks essentially its just blue beams powering it like come on are you telling me this is the best they could come up with sometimes it just looks like some electricity powered technology which breaks quite the atmosphere this my suggestion make it more reactive with some interesting properties like it changing color shape or flow under certain circumstances such change would expand the functionalities and even power of hextech but could also create new weaknesses and obstacles around its development that will result in more complexity and diversity on how hextech devices look and work

 bueno at this point i think i have nothing else to add comments that dont agree with this post are not welcomed kidding please share what you think on the comments"

reflections on lowelo gameplay challenges with teamwork communication and the current system
"i havent played league of legends in a couple of years but i recently jumped back in ive always known about elo hell since im not that great but the toxicity in iron and bronze has gotten significantly worse its almost unbearable the constant trash talk the refusal to take responsibilityeveryones always blaming someone else were literally in the lowest ranks and yet people complain about others being bad when realistically we all kind of suck the quitting the throwing the toxic behaviorit makes the experience incredibly frustrating

and if you try to play with a friend to make it more bearable forget it the matchmaking balances the team by giving you worse teammatesto make up for the advantage or so i have read so you and your friend end up suffering together

then theres the reporting system if you tell one of these toxic players to stop boomyoure reported it feels like everything is reportable now league has cultivated a community of tattletales who provoke others and then cry foul the reporting system clearly isnt working because this behavior still runs rampant in almost every lowelo game it seems like the structure of the system actually incentivizes this kind of behavior since players know how easy it is to get someone penalized

i get it the knowitall advice is always just mute chat sure but who actually wants to mute chat all the timeespecially in solo or duo games even in coaching videos people suggest muting chat but is that really the game experience we want and that to be the solution

so what can be done here are a few suggestions

1	revamp the ranking system in low elo

incentivize teamwork instead of punishing it right now duoing often results in worse teammates but teamwork should be encouraged consider incorporating individual performance metrics into rankings especially in iron and bronze
	
2	rework the chat and reporting system

let people talk without encouraging a cry wolf mentality allow players to defend themselves if thats not possible maybe just remove chat entirely in lower ranks i know this contradicts what i said earlier but honestly if the chat is just full of complaints id rather have silence

i come from the days of oldschool xbox when people said whatever they wanted weirdly enough that created its own kind of balance now it feels like the reporting system is just exploited for petty reasons

i know nothing will change the reddit crowd will just say get better but realistically i probably wonti dont have the time to grind and improve i just love league and want to enjoy the time i do spend playing

any suggestions on how to deal with this or improve the experience maybe we can improve it "

arurf solo lane with jungle role
"i dont get why when theres a possible chance to have a jg and have one person solo lane besides mid ofc why its so difficult to execute  
  
i think having a jg not only makes objections much easier but ganking and farming much more valuable for both the solo laner and the jungler   
  
and of course this doesnt work for all comps but if i get rolled a jungle champ and i am interested to jungle and it also just so happens my team chooses to play champs who have crazy wave clear why tf not why is that so hard to do  


if i have sivir brand malz xerath in my team you could literally be in a position to farm what you can but most importantly farm safely against two other champs   
  
multiple times have i been in this situation and all they do is feed im talking about how everyone things theyre faker and they can 1 v 2 everyone and anyone chill tf out farm and stay safe and let me take the objectives let me help the other lanes possibly even yours because i know damn well theyll be pushed   
  
because this is my philosophy if you are playing someone like sivir or any top tier wave clear champ and you cant survive alone from lv 1  lv 5 without feeding i thank god i wasnt in lane with you in the first place lord knows wtf you woulda done if i was in lane with you not farming thats for sure   


please let me see another perspective and have a good brotherly talk about this please    "

lethality stat idea
i feel like most smart people can agree that ad assassins feel like ass to play alot of them struggling to find a place in the meta especially if they arent auto attack focused the assassin that can use things like ldr are usually in a better spot since crit is a great stat for burst dmg i honestly think that lethality as a stat should focus more on damage done through abilities and nerf how it works for auto attack reason why i say this is mostly because of how bad it feels when adcs can make full use of lethality if lethality solely or mostly worked on abilities then i could see the stat itself getting buffed i honestly believe auto attackers have enough stats that play into each other critascrit amp lifesteal and currently lethality ability users got adcdr lethality and a very small amount of omnivamp in rare cases genuine thoughts

how to find your main champion in lol
"httpspreviewredditvzqjxy9yikje1pngwidth1024formatpngautowebps615757330d159ba8a0f9c7d0e2d84c201fab4db3

hey guys

ive recently posted a guidehttpschampbopcomleagueoflegendshowtofindyourmainchampioninleagueoflegends on how to find your main champ

some key points i went over were

 why finding a main champion matters

 maining a champion brings consistency and improves performance
 it removes the variable of unfamiliarity helping you focus on strategy

 1 try a few champions and analyze what you like

 play different champions and figure out what aspects of their playstyle you enjoy
 find similar champions that share those traits but offer slight variations

 2 see if you want to play them even after losing

 they might be your main if you still enjoy playing a champion after a bad game
 you can just experiment with free rotation champions to find one that clicks

 3 learn about your champion and limittest

 stick with a champion and keep improving through practice and mechanics
 learning matchups and new strategies will make the game more rewarding

 4 watch content creators and onetrick players

 watching skilled players can teach you advanced mechanics and strategies
 some content creators popularize unique builds that can inspire your gameplay

 5 choose whats fun for you

 your main should be a champion you genuinely enjoy playing
 whether you like aggressive outplays tanky frontline play or supportive roles pick what feels best

please let me know if i am missing something

any constructive feedback is welcome thank you"

why lane swaps needs to be removed and how to do it
"hi everyone here are my thoughts on lane swap as an esport enjoyer

why it should be removed 

 from a spectator point of view it removes the thrill of early levels trading toplane solo kills and botlane 2v2 kills
 from a competitive point of view toplane champion pool is restricted  some champions cant be picked just because if they get lane swaped on they are useless mostly carry toplaners gankplank and camille for example
 the game is meant to be played like this  toplaner  botlaner  support lane swap should be considered as an abuse of the rules


how to remove it 

1 before 0500 supports cant earn xp from toplane minions  supports have no business being top before grubs spawn

2 before 0500 toplane turret instantly overheats 250 damage if 3 or more champions are nearby  you cant dive 3v1 anymore let toplaners enjoy their game

3 remove botlane fortifications  if botlane turret is defended only by toplaner enemy botlane can really abuse it


first two changes will have zero impact on soloq maybe change n2 once in a while if mid and jungler decide to dive top early but is acceptable again let toplaners play the game
change n3 may lead to botlane fiesta and more ranged supports may need some follow up changes

what do you think

blue lock ego
i recently watched blue lock and was wondering what role and champion would be most similar to being a striker given that its a carry position and requires ego my initial thought was jungle seeing as it has the most potential impact with it having influence on each lane more specifically a more invadeaggressive heavy jungler like rengar graves etc what do you guys think

"dont get me wrong 2025 welcome to noxus 2024 still here 2022 the call 2020 warriors and 2019 awaken are great cinematic that have cool animations with a background music showing scenes from the gamelore

but i miss having a cinematic with strong fights punches and blood the last one was a new dawn 2014 where you can see rengar jumping on top of draven and eviscerating his face out of screen graves shotgunning katarina in the face and later exploding himself to stop nautilus and also leona burning darius alive

we also had a twist of fate 2013 with good fights and showing us for the first time the new baron look before the summoners rift update and also older ones like dominion and welcome to league of legends

i feel like the 2021 one ruination was almost like the old school cinematics 

so yeah i love the new ones but wish we had more like the old ones with great action scenes even now that the champion pool is bigger"

its about time to release pool party ahriluxvaynejinx and etc
"so over the years we know they been claiming they have been struggling on monetization

along time ago i vaguely remember one claiming that the only way they would release a pool party ahri skin is if they where financially struggling with the removal of hextech chests and them making 200 skins and gacha wouldnt you classify that as struggling so why havnt they pulled out the pool party ahrijinxlux tbh they would sell like hotcakes hell probably even more so than the 500 skin

and tbh its been so long since we had the pool party thematic and i mean true pool party not the ocean songsunkissed stuff now it may be similar but its not the true essence of pool party

v down below is an old login screen of pool party such an amazing thing we had back then
